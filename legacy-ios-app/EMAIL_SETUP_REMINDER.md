## Can You Do This Through Apple?

**Short answer: No, Apple doesn't provide custom email hosting.**

Apple offers:
- **iCloud email** (@icloud.com, @me.com) - But you can't use your own domain
- **iCloud+ Custom Email Domain** - YES! This is what you want (see below)

3. Perfect integration with all your Apple devices

## Questions?

This needs to be done **before submitting to App Store** since the privacy policy references this email address.
